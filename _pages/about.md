## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at New Mexico State University with **8+ years of industry experience** in hardware design, embedded systems, and power electronics. My expertise spans the complete product development lifecycle—from concept and schematic capture through multi-layer PCB layout, fabrication, bring-up, and validation.

## Research & Expertise

My research focuses on **SoC power and thermal modeling**, power management, and hardware performance optimization. I have extensive hands-on experience delivering production-ready PCB designs for:

- **Industrial Control Systems**
- **IoT and Smart Devices**
- **Automotive Telematics**
- **Medical Electronics**

## Technical Proficiency

I specialize in:

- **Multi-layer PCB Design** (up to 8 layers) using Altium Designer
- **High-Speed Digital Design** with power integrity and EMI-aware layout
- **Embedded Systems Development** on AVR, PIC, ESP32, and Nvidia Jetson platforms
- **Power Electronics** including PMIC, BMS, and motor control systems
- **Communication Protocols**: UART, I2C, SPI, CAN, USB, Ethernet, GSM/GPRS, GPS

## Professional Background

Previously, I served as Senior Hardware Design Engineer at Tatweer Middle East & Africa (UAE), where I designed automotive-grade telematics devices and solar MPPT controllers. Earlier, I managed the Multi-Layer PCB Laboratory at the Egyptian Armed Forces Research Center, overseeing fabrication and quality assurance for complex defense electronics projects.

I hold a **Master's degree in Power Electronics and Control Engineering** from Menoufia University (Egypt) and am currently pursuing dual graduate degrees (Ph.D. and M.Sc.) at NMSU with a perfect 4.0 GPA.
